This repository contains the implementation of the methods described in the paper:
"Algorithm for computing time correlation functions in non-stationary complex dynamic systems" 


1. **MultiPointMain.mlx**  
   This script performs the calculation fo multi-point time correlation functions.

2. **TwoPointMain.mlx**  
   This script performs the calculation fo tow-point time correlation functions.

3. **index_2010_2024.mat**  
   This is the data file used by the scripts.

## Prerequisites

To run these files, you will need:
- MATLAB
